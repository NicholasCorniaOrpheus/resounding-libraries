# Orpheus Instituut - Resounding Libraries
Repository for the Resounding Libraries research cluster at Orpheus Instituut.


## Credentials

After cloning this repository, you should create a `credentials` folder to store all your sensible data. All credentials are stored in `credentials.json` file in this form:

```json
{
	"koha": {
		"oauth_credentials": {
    	"description": "username",
    	"client_id": "clientid generated by Koha",
    	"secret_key": "secret key generated by Koha"
		},
	"basic_credentials": {
    	"user": "user@email.com",
    	"password": "password"
		}

	},
	"resourcespace": {
		"rs_api_url": "https://your.rs.domain/api/v1/",
		"secret_key": "secret key" 
	}
}
```

## ResourceSpace
[Resourcespace](https://www.resourcespace.com/) is an open source digital assets management system.

In the folder `resourcespace` you can find some useful Python scripts to dynamically interact with your Resourcespace instance. 
Metadata for each record are pulled through Koha and ingested to Resource Space fields, collections and resources.

## Koha

This folder collects a series of Python scripts, build upon [pyMARC](https://pymarc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),  to allow batch operation for your library catalogue, Koha API and other mappings useful for enriching metadata with external, linked open data information.

- Koha reports enhancement to JSON.
- MARC authorities and biblioitems conversion to JSON.
- MARC abbreviations conversion.
- ...

## ORCID

[ORCID](https://orcid.org/) is a non-profit organization that provides a persistent digital identifier (an ORCID iD) that distinguishes you from every other researcher.
Since 2023, Orpheus Instituut registers the research output of its members through the Koha catalogue. Each research output is stored as record and a plugin has been developed to batch export the data to [FRIS](https://researchportal.be/en).

In the folder `orcid` you can find some useful Python scripts, build upon [pyOrcid](https://github.com/sri0606/PyOrcid)to dynamically interact with your ORCID instance.
