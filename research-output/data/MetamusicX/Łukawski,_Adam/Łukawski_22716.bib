 abstract = {The focus of this course is on how existing AI (Artificial Intelligence) and blockchain tools can
enhance the creative capabilities of a musician today and how does this change the creative
practices that we know. The aim is to provide to participants the basic knowledge about the new
paradigms of (digital) art creation and dissemination and to navigate them towards the digital tools
enabling post-human creativity to become part of their own artistic practice. Some of the questions
that the course strives to answer are: how can human creativity be enhanced by Artificial
Intelligence? What are the good techniques for music composition with AI and blockchain? How is
the definition of a work of art different today than 300 years ago and 100 years ago? What is the
purpose of decentralised music? What is the agency of the work of art in the post-human era? Can
the work of art posses itself?},
