 abstract = {This paper proposes a new conceptual framework for the creation of an interoperable metaverse seamlessly incorporating AI and blockchain technologies. To achieve this, current issues of interoperability within the discipline’s state-of-the-art are first identified. Next, a new virtual ontology of the interoperable metaverse is proposed, inspired by recent developments in assemblage theory and in specific concepts by Gilles Deleuze, Manuel DeLanda, and Paulo de Assis. In the third and fourth parts of this paper, a new technical solution is presented: a taxonomy of Periodic Spacetime Sequences, devised for practical implementation of a new distributed version control system. This solution could offer an innovative framework for the interoperable metaverse, which could be built using the proposed taxonomy.},

Each instructional session involves theoretical discussion followed by practical hands-on experience, such as composing with AI models or creating music NFTs.

The course delves into key questions such as the enhancement of human creativity through AI, effective techniques for composing music with AI and blockchain, the changing definition of art over the centuries, the significance of decentralized music, and the role and ownership of art in the post-human era. The goal of the course is to equip students with an understanding of how AI and blockchain technologies can augment and redefine the creative processes in music. The course explores the potential of these digital tools in shaping post-human artistic practices and helps participants grasp the evolving paradigms of art creation.

In the 2023-2024 period, students signing up for either "Posthuman Creativity Labs: Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain in Music" course, or "Technological Strategies in Composing and Performing" taught by Arnold Marinissen, were enrolled for a joint course consisting of both of these complementary courses, together consisting of 16 integrated sessions.},

ENG: 
The advisory working group on Artificial Intelligence was appointed by the Minister of Education and Sciences of the Republic of Poland. This group includes members from various sectors: state (Ministry of Education and Sciences), commercial (Microsoft, Google), research (Institute for Educational Research, IBE), and educational organisations. This is a second guide in a series aimed at teachers, focusing on the integration of Artificial Intelligence in educational settings. This guide has been disseminated across Polish educational institutions at all levels through a state-managed digital educational platform.

Przedstawiamy kolejny przewodnik dla nauczycieli przygotowany przez Ministerstwo Edukacji i Nauki. W publikacji zastanawiamy się nad kreatywnością dużych modeli językowych.
W poradniku „Chat GPT w szkole. Szanse i zagrożenia” odpowiadaliśmy na pytania dotyczące istoty sztucznej inteligencji i jej zastosowań w edukacji. Omawialiśmy szczegółowo narzędzia wykorzystujące sztuczną inteligencję, przedstawiliśmy ChatGPT i analizowaliśmy jego wpływ na proces nauczania. Dodatkowo zwróciliśmy uwagę na kluczowe elementy pracy pedagogicznej z wykorzystaniem bota.

Wyzwania dla współczesnej szkoły
Od tego czasu wiele się zmieniło w związku z dynamicznym rozwojem zaawansowanych modeli językowych. Dlatego też postanowiliśmy wydać kolejny poradnik „Do czego AI nie służy” skupiający się na modelach językowych. Dokument ten wychodzi naprzeciw zmieniającej się rzeczywistości i potrzebom edukacyjnym.

W dzisiejszym świecie jedyną stałą wydaje się nieustanna zmiana. Kompetencje, które nabywamy w szkole i życiu dorosłym, dezaktualizują szybciej niż kiedykolwiek wcześniej. Zjawisko to wynika z gigantycznego przyrostu nowych informacji w krótkim czasie. Stąd też naszym celem jest zrozumienie, które kompetencje stają się kluczowe w kontekście szybko zmieniających się realiów edukacyjnych.

Sztuczna inteligencja a kreatywność
Według modelu 4K kluczowymi umiejętnościami są: kreatywność, komunikacja, krytyczne myślenie i kooperacja. Kreatywność była dotychczas uznawana za kompetencję typowo ludzką, ale jej definicja, w związku z rozwojem badań nad generatywną sztuczną inteligencją, znów staje się przedmiotem debaty, również w kontekście edukacyjnym.

W przewodniku „Do czego AI nie służy” zastanawiamy się nad kreatywnością dużych modeli językowych, analizujemy etyczno-moralne aspekty korzystania z nich oraz prezentujemy wskazówki dla nauczycieli. Ostatni rozdział skupia się na przykładach niepożądanych zachowań użytkowników AI w szkole oraz definiuje zagrożenia związane z wdrażaniem rozwiązań AI w edukacji.},

@incollection{Łukawski_22714,
 abstract = {This chapter introduces two new concepts: ‘Decentralized Creative Networks’ and ‘Performative Transactions’. Decentralized Creative Networks are envisioned as blockchain-based post-human social networks, in which artists and AI agents develop and transact composable artistic processes, transparently building upon each other’s interoperable contributions. These processes are shared in Decentralized Creative Networks like social media posts. Artists can use them to shape their artistic work, by making it dependent on the execution of processes created by other artists and AI agents (for instance to compose music, to execute live performances of an artistic work, or to generate non-fungible tokens). Performative Transaction is a kind of transaction specific to these networks. It is executed by a smart contract, the code of which specifies both the artistic process and the terms of referencing it by other processes. To ensure interoperability, artistic processes in the system are composed as recursive patterns of transformations in a framework inspired by the Transformational Theory of David Lewin and Machine Learning’s feature engineering. When interlinked Performative Transactions are executed, smart contracts carry out all referenced musical transformations contributing to the musical result. They also automatically distribute any financial receivables to the creators of all referenced artistic processes. Furthermore, the integration of Artificial Intelligence within Decentralized Creative Networks is discussed, suggesting a collaborative framework where human and AI agents interact, actively shaping the artistic network. These interactions are further elucidated on the examples of music composition, performance, analysis, and sound synthesis, demonstrating the versatility of Performative Transactions for musical use cases. While recognizing the potential of Decentralized Creative Networks, the chapter acknowledges current challenges for their development. Overcoming these challenges could significantly impact how art is created, shared, and experienced in the digital era.},

Intelligence? What are the good techniques for music composition with AI and blockchain? How is
the definition of a work of art different today than 300 years ago and 100 years ago? What is the
purpose of decentralised music? What is the agency of the work of art in the post-human era? Can

This public evening addresses the increasing entanglement of music, digital networks, and algorithmic processes in artistic practices today. As artificial intelligence and decentralized technologies gain prominence, they challenge traditional notions of creativity, authorship, and collaboration in the arts. Exploring these topics is crucial now, as they reshape not only how music is made and shared but also its aesthetic and social dimensions.
