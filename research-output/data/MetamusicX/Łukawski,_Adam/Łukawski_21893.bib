 abstract = {One 2-hours-long session per month, 8 sessions in total. Seminar-style lectures and workshops (4 sessions), creative labs for hands-on experimentation (4 sessions). Each instructional session involves theoretical discussion followed by practical hands-on experience, such as composing with AI models or creating music NFTs.

The course delves into key questions such as the enhancement of human creativity through AI, effective techniques for composing music with AI and blockchain, the changing definition of art over the centuries, the significance of decentralized music, and the role and ownership of art in the post-human era. The goal of the course is to equip students with an understanding of how AI and blockchain technologies can augment and redefine the creative processes in music. The course explores the potential of these digital tools in shaping post-human artistic practices and helps participants grasp the evolving paradigms of art creation.

In the 2023-2024 period, students signing up for either "Posthuman Creativity Labs: Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain in Music" course, or "Technological Strategies in Composing and Performing" taught by Arnold Marinissen, were enrolled for a joint course consisting of both of these complementary courses, together consisting of 16 integrated sessions.},
