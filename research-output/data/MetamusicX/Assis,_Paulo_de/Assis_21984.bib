 abstract = {Michael Schwab’s recent essay ‘Contemporary Research’, published in the inaugural issue of 'HUB - Journal of Research in Art, Design and Society', is an excellent, timely, and thought-provoking essay that resumes conceptual discussions about artistic research in a manner that has not been seen in the last decade. The text is both an invitation to revisit some of the fundamentals of artistic research as well as a strong plea for remaining intellectually active, also (and especially) as an artist-researcher.},
