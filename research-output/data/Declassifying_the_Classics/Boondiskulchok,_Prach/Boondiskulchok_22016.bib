Karmic Songs is a set of reflections on the concepts of the soul, ghosts, and karma, inspired by Thai
folktales and Theravadin Buddhist thoughts. The first song sets Mary Oliver’s poem Bone, where, in search
for what the soul might be, the narrator finds an ear bone of a whale and contemplates on whether the
soul might look like this—the ear bone is crucial to the whale’s ability to navigate. This resonates with
how it is also the most crucial part for musicians, and is, in a way, like their “souls”. The second and third
songs set an assemblage of texts from many sources, from old Buddhist Suttas to contemporary poems
which I have borrowed and threaded together. Telling the story of a Preta or “hungry ghost”, one of the
ghosts commonly used in Thailand to scare children from misbehaving, myself affected. In this song the
ghost itself warns us, the living, of our greed and endless “wanting more and more of the earth”. The final
song is a prayer of hope, calling upon the “miracles of honesty and truth to keep the sky from falling.”
