 note = {This piano quintet follows a long musical tradition of compositions inspired by the Danse Macabre, a theme prevalent in 15th-century art, skeletons are depicted dancing alongside characters from every societal rank, an allegory of death’s universality.

The idea of a Danse Macabre as a theme fitting for a left-handed-piano-quintet came to me accidentally: one unremarkable night, having slept on my right arm until it went numb, moving it produced a strange sense that it was not my arm—a kind of “phantom limb” experience (or perhaps the reverse). The metaphor of the “phantom” seemed to me to tie together many disparate ideas related the story of the left-handed-pianist: invisibility, disability, extreme virtuosity, the “forgotten” hand, and ultimately a sort of memento mori.

The piece’s structure follows the common medieval depiction as shown in the image above (John of Kastav, Holy Trinity Church in Hrastovlje, Slovenia). Here Death, manifested as skeletons, dances with earthly characters one by one. In this piece, Death is represented by bells (an homage to Henri Cazalis’s poem, that in turn inspired the most popular of all Danses Macabres by Saint-Saëns) followed by a somewhat grotesque attempt to dance. In between each manifestation of this, there are six tableaux of living beings: the princess, the beggar, the patriot, the very busy, the dreamer, and the child. While we can very well imagine these six as medieval characters, we also know them well as contemporary stereotypes. The final tableau, a waltz, sees materials from each of the characters dancing all together, on a thin line between joy and denial, between beauty and banality.},

Karmic Songs is a set of reflections on the concepts of the soul, ghosts, and karma, inspired by Thai
folktales and Theravadin Buddhist thoughts. The first song sets Mary Oliver’s poem Bone, where, in search
for what the soul might be, the narrator finds an ear bone of a whale and contemplates on whether the
soul might look like this—the ear bone is crucial to the whale’s ability to navigate. This resonates with
how it is also the most crucial part for musicians, and is, in a way, like their “souls”. The second and third
songs set an assemblage of texts from many sources, from old Buddhist Suttas to contemporary poems
which I have borrowed and threaded together. Telling the story of a Preta or “hungry ghost”, one of the
ghosts commonly used in Thailand to scare children from misbehaving, myself affected. In this song the
ghost itself warns us, the living, of our greed and endless “wanting more and more of the earth”. The final
song is a prayer of hope, calling upon the “miracles of honesty and truth to keep the sky from falling.”

 note = {The Linos Piano Trio presents the music of Ravel in a fascinating light, performing on period instruments and exploring Ravel’s own relationship with the past.

As well as the Piano Trio in A minor, the disc includes Linos’s own arrangements of Ravel’s Pavane pour une infante défunte and Le Tombeau de Couperin — an extension of their ‘Stolen Music’ project, in which they collaboratively re-imagine orchestral masterpieces as if they had been initially conceived for Piano Trio.

By using period instruments, the Linos players find a wider range of colour in Ravel’s music, and a more timbrally-entwined balance between the three instruments. Violinist Konrad Elias-Trostmann and cellist Vladimir Waltham play on a combination of plain and wound gut strings, while Pianist Prach Boondiskulchok performs on an 1882 Érard Concert Grand piano, the same make and a very similar model to the piano Ravel himself owned and composed with.

While the Pavane, composed in 1899, depicts an imagined dance in a 17th-century Spanish court and the Tombeau presents a series of neo-baroque dances, composed against the backdrop of the First World War, the Linos players have also come to see the Piano Trio as a set of dances. Completed in 1914, immediately before Ravel enlisted for military service, the Trio speaks to Le Tombeau across the historical divide of the outbreak of war in their ‘search for lost dances’: “the Piano Trio imagines dances of his childhood, dances of faraway places, dances of victory and death, while Le Tombeau reimagines dances from faraway times”.},
