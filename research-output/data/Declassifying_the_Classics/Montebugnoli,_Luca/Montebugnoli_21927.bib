Abstract:
October 1803: On hearing Beethoven play the Eroica symphony on his new Erard Frères piano, a witness remarked, “Heaven and Earth must shake at its performance.” Inspired by this historical scene, Luca Montebugnoli has created a new arrangement of the symphony tailored to a unique replica of Beethoven’s Erard. By delivering a novel interpretation of an iconic work, Montebugnoli revives the neglected art of piano arrangement, while also exploring the full potential of what was in Beethoven’s life a revolutionary instrument.

Program:
- Joseph Haydn, Die Schöpfung, Hob. XXI:2, Einleitung: Die Vorstellung des Chaos, Largo, arranged by Daniel Steibelt
- Ludwig van Beethoven, Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major, op. 55, “Eroica”, arranged by Luca Montebugnoli

Instrument:
Replica of Beethoven’s Erard Frères piano en forme de clavecin (Paris, 1803), by Chris Maene (Ruiselede, 2016)},
