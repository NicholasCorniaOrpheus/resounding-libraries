 abstract = {This presentation examined the wave of piano reductions of Haydn’s Die Schöpfung published between 1800 and 1801, emphasizing the diversity among seven versions issued by musicians such as Müller, Neukomm, Clementi, and Steibelt. Focusing on the opening movement, “Die Vorstellung des Chaos,” the analysis compared the arrangers’ differing strategies and considered how their choices were shaped by the piano technologies of the time. The study highlighted how each version reinterprets the oratorio’s narrative and reflects the broader pianistic and cultural contexts of the early nineteenth century. The presentation concluded with a discussion of my arrangement of the fourth movement of Beethoven’s Eroica Symphony, conceived for a replica of the 1803 Erard piano owned by the composer.},

Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach’s Sonatas with Varied Reprises (published in Berlin, 1760) constituted a bold experiment. Spelling out every repeat, Bach applies to each the art of variation. Starting off as a service (“play this and you’ll sound as if you’re improvising”), the opus ends up a masterclass in variation. Tom Beghin, playing his own beloved clavichord, enacts the role of the keyboardist-composer who repeats himself, while never saying the same thing twice.
