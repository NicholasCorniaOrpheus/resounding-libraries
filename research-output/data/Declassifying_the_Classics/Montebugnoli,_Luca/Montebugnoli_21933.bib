 abstract = {How did the arranging practice operate in the nineteenth century musical ecosystem? Which were the concrete tools of such a practice? How can this professional practice be reintroduced in the context of modern musical concert activity? And what the historically informed performance of orchestral music on early-ninetheenth century fortepianos can teach us about the pianism of the time? Luca Montebugnoli will address these questions by presenting his arrangement of Beethoven’s Third Symphony Op. 55 (“Bonaparte,” later “Eroica”), which he specifically designed for Orpheus Instituut's replica of Beethoven’s 1803 Erard Frères piano.},
