 abstract = {October 1803: On hearing Beethoven play the Eroica symphony on his new Erard Frères piano, a witness remarked, “Heaven and Earth must shake at its performance.” Inspired by this historical scene, Luca Montebugnoli has created a new arrangement of the symphony tailored to a unique replica of Beethoven’s Erard. By delivering a novel interpretation of an iconic work, Montebugnoli revives the neglected art of piano arrangement, while also exploring the full potential of what was in Beethoven’s life a revolutionary instrument.
