 note = {Abstract:
Luca Montebugnoli (piano) and Laura Andriani (violin) explore links with Christoph Willibald Gluck’s operas in the accompanied piano music of Jean-Louis Adam, Jean-Frédéric Edelmann, and Daniel Steibelt. Playing a 1791 Pascal Taskin square piano, freshly restored by Pianos Maene (Ruiselede), they bring to life pre- and post-revolutionary repertoire from the Parisian salon, alternating original music for piano and violin with arrangements.
