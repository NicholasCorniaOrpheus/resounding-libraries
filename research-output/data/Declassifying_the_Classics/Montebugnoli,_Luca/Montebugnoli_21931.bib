 abstract = {Lecture at Oprheus Insituut's Third Historical Piano Summer Academy: "Luca Montebugnoli will present his arrangement of Beethoven’s Third Symphony Op. 55 (“Bonaparte,” later “Eroica”), which he specifically designed for Oprheus Instiuut replica of Beethoven’s 1803 Erard Frères piano, as part of his PhD-research on the practice of arrangement in the early 19th century. Beethoven was in the final stages of composing the work as he received the piano. By exploiting its sound qualities and unique registers, the arrangement aim to reconstruct the effect that Ferdinand Ries was enthusiastic about, when upon a performance by Beethoven (almost certainly) on his newly received French piano, he predicted in a letter of October 22, 1803, that 'heaven and earth will shake at its performance.'"},
