 abstract = {Lecture at Orpheus Instituut General Assembly: "How did the arranging practice operate in the nineteenth century musical ecosystem? Which were the concrete tools of such a practice? How can this professional practice be reintroduced in the context of modern musical concert activity? And what the historically informed performance of orchestral music on early-ninetheenth century fortepianos can teach us about the pianism of the time? Luca Montebugnoli will address these questions by presenting two projects of his doctoral research on piano arrangement at the beginning of the ninetennth century. First, he will share the results of a comparative analysis carried out on five historical arrangements of Haydn’s “Die Vorstellung der Chaos” from the oratorio Die Schöpfung, Hob. XXI:2. He will then present his arrangement of Beethoven’s Third Symphony Op. 55 (“Bonaparte,” later “Eroica”), which he specifically designed for a replica of Beethoven’s 1803 Erard Frères piano."},
