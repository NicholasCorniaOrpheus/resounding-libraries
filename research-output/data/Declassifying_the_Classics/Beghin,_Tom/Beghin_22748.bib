In 1775 Leopold Mozart inquired with Breitkopf in Leipzig whether he might like to print an opus of keyboard sonatas by Wolfgang Amadeus, “in the same manner as those of H: Philipp Carl Emanuel Bach mit veränderten Reprisen.” Almost certainly, Leopold was pitching his son’s recently completed Sonatas K. 279-284 (1774-75). The publication did not happen, but the question is intriguing: what might Mozart’s Six Sonatas with Varied Reprises have looked like?
Alternately on clavichord and fortepiano, this concert features two Sonatas with Varied Reprises by C. P. E. Bach, the third and fourth of Wq 50 (published in 1760), along with K 279 and K 282 of Mozart, as the first and fourth of an opus that might have been published with written-out repeat and variation.
