 note = {Abstract:
C. P. E. Bach’s Sonatas with Varied Reprises, published in Berlin, 1760, constituted a bold experiment. Throughout this opus of six Bach spelled out every repeat, integrating into the printed text his own composed variations. This practice of varying repeats normally belonged to the realm of the performer, so Bach was treading on unchartered territory, even inventing (in his own words) “a new genre.” Starting off as a service (“play this and you’ll sound as if you’re improvising”), the opus ends up a masterclass in variation. Tom Beghin, playing his own beloved clavichord (by Joris Potvlieghe, 2003), enacts the role of the keyboardist-composer who repeats himself, while never saying the same thing twice.
