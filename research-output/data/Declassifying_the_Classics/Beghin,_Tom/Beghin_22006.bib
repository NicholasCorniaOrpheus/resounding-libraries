 note = {Performing on clavichord and fortepiano, Tom Beghin explores a once lively practice of varying repeats through two sets of keyboard sonatas—for a total of twelve, to be digested in groups of three: CPE Bach’s Sechs Sonaten mit veränderten Reprisen, Wq 50 (1760) and Mozart’s six “Munich” Sonatas K 279–285 (1774–75). Sonatas by C. P. E. Bach (Wq. 50, 1 and 3) and W. A. Mozart (K. 279).},
