Performing on clavichord and fortepiano, Tom Beghin explores a once lively practice of varying repeats through two sets of keyboard sonatas—for a total of twelve, to be digested in groups of three: CPE Bach’s Sechs Sonaten mit veränderten Reprisen, Wq 50 (1760) and Mozart’s six “Munich” Sonatas K 279–285 (1774–75).
