 abstract = {Throughout this review, I will explore the impact of Smolicki’s questions through some of the texts contained in this book, with the support of a handful of its important references – mainly Dylan Robinson (2020), Val Plumwood (1995) and Sara Ahmed (2006). Before proceeding, I need to take a closer look at the aforementioned questions in order to establish my orientation marks, the themes that will loosely anchor this review. First, I am interested in understanding how soundwalking can be deployed as a technique or a condition “for disrupting the familiar.” That initial investigation will then allow me to consider the aims towards which this technique could be deployed, i.e., “familiarizing with the unknown” and “reconfiguring how we sense and act in the world today.” If the hypothesis implied in Smolicki’s questions holds, namely, if soundwalking can, in fact, be considered as a method to help us actualize the recurring metaphor of listening as an “openness to the exterior world to take input and be disturbed” (Droumeva, p. 80), and if said disturbances can indeed reconfigure how we sense and act in the world, then soundwalking might be considered a tool in service of a wider ethical program, one that facilitates a better attunement “to the particular filters of race, class, gender, and ability that actively select and frame the moment of contact between the listening body and the listened-to sound” and a “listening otherwise” (Robinson, p. 11) oriented towards social and environmental justice.},

 abstract = {The primary goal with the elaboration of the present text consists of discussing aspects of the process and creative approach of Brazilian artists Thelmo Cristovam and Alexandre Fenerich, with the aim of better understanding their artistic work involving the use of field recordings. Departing from a free reflection regarding the idea of presence in field recordings, developed around texts by Mark Peter Wright, Salomé Voegelin, Tullis Rennie and Isobel Anderson, there follows an analysis and elaborations on excerpts of original interviews and conversations with Cristovam and Fenerich, taking into account their particular narratives regarding the process of creation of such works as Duas Estórias Domésticas Colapsadas and Coleção Peripatética de Sons. This approach reveals uses of field recordings particular to these authors: Cristovam is very much aware of his presence in his recordings, even in those that are characterised by the absence of any sound of an anthropic origin. And Fenerich seems to have found a method in the wandering: there are not, necessarily, projects that are already conceived and that determine a systematic in his outings with the aim of recording. These projects could be discovered during or even after the act of recording.},

 abstract = {In this presentation I will reflect on experiences that prompted me to reassess some aspects of my field recording activities. Those experiences are related to the recording sessions for Cidade Arquipélago (2015), an album predominantly featuring binaural field recordings produced in Japan, conducted between 2014-15. My subsequent 2023 research in Tokyo was motivated by the realisation that many of the album's recordings presented sonic situations commonly explored by other sound artists, potentially contributing to a stereotypical portrayal of ‘Japanese (sonic) culture’. Dissatisfied, I resolved to revisit the original recording sites, focusing not on a perceived ‘Japanesenes’ of events, but on personal memories associated with the 2014-15 recordings. The 2023 recording sessions were marked by disappointment, overshadowed by the memory of the original recordings. Consequently, I shifted focus towards exploring presence, routines, and the repetitive nature of everyday life. This led my research to gradually delve into 'sound routines' found in Tokyo, providing a means to immerse in the city's rhythms through auditory experiences. A handful of sound works emerged, documenting routine phenomena by overlaying multiple recordings of the same recurring situations, while moving away from a singular focus on 'culturally symbolic' sounds. Additionally, certain sound events served as scores for electronic instruments developed during the creative process.},

 abstract = {Thresh + Hold is a multimodal report on the generative distance between experiences of loss as they relate to sound: losses of quality, memory, presence, time, labor, resources, intimacy, and voice. It works by juxtaposing and overlaying different kinds of loss across media formats: cyanotypes of fieldwork photos that make visible the loss of light as it imprints on the photographic medium; interlocking collages of absent sounds punctuating time spent and time lost in the field; and fragments of conversations that evoke thresholds of (mis)understanding, (mis)hearing, and (mis)communicating. By bringing together our materials, we commit to trust through tinkering and to tinkering with trust. The project received funding from the Dutch Research Council (NWO).},

 abstract = {A simple composition using underwater stereo recordings from the Tatekawa, a river flowing into Tokyo’s Sumida River. Originally created for Mieko Matsumoto’s video in the Breathing Particles exhibition at TOKAS Hongo Gallery, Tokyo (July–August 2024). Above the river lies the Shuto Expressway, an elevated highway built for “practicality,” accelerating the river’s original transportation functions. From within the Tatekawa, the expressway’s intense activity and maintenance work are audible. On quieter days, with the use of filters, some species adapting to these changes can still be heard. These recordings layer different times and speeds in the urban “now”: the natural rivers, now channeled, and their modern counterparts—the expressways immortalized by Tarkovsky and Oshii. Distant sine wave allusions to Hana, a Western-style song by Rentaro Taki, emerge, as if engulfing the Tatekawa’s sounds.},
