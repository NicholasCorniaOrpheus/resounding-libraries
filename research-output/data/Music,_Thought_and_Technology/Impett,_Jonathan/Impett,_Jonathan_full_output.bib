 abstract = {Of the post-war, post-serialist generation of European composers, it was Luigi Nono who succeeded not only in identifying and addressing aesthetic and technical questions of his time, but in showing a way ahead to a new condition of music in the twenty-first century. His music has found a listenership beyond the ageing constituency of contemporary music. In Nonos work, the audiences of sound art, improvisation, electronic, experimental and radical musics of many kinds find common cause with those concerned with the renewal of Western art music. His work explores the individually and socially transformative role of music; its relationship with history and with language; the nature of the musical work as distributed through text, time, technology and individuals; the nature and performativity of the act of composition; and, above all, the role and nature of listening as a cultural activity. In many respects his music anticipates the new technological state of culture of the twenty-first century while radically reconnecting with our past. His work is itself a case study in the evolution of musical activity and the musical object: from the period of an apparently stable place for art music in Western culture to its manifold new states in our century. Routledge Handbook to Luigi Nono and Musical Thought seeks to trace the evolution of Nonos musical thought through detailed examination of the vast body of sketches, and to situate this narrative in its personal, cultural and political contexts.},

 abstract = {Setting out from an eighteenth-century portrait of ‘virtuosis’, this chapter considers how some historical understandings of the notion of virtuosity might inform a relevant contemporary concept. A view based on pure technique or charlatanism has been criticised as banal almost since the term ‘virtuoso’ has been understood principally to refer to a musical performer. Instead, we attempt to synthesise a new formulation derived from usage in art history and the natural sciences, as well as notions of virtue from historical and recent philosophy; virtuosi might be seen as explorers, as plotting paths to ‘speculative knowledge’. While technique remains an important vehicle, cultural vision and social empathy are shown to be crucial, particularly in a moment of fragmentation such as our own. The expertise most crucial to the contemporary virtuoso is that of understanding, articulating and performing new potentialities that inhere in a particular moment and space.},

 abstract = {Responses to AI vacillate between the epochal or post-human – Stephen Hawking foresees a tipping point when AI becomes able to set its own goals – and the thoroughly prosaic – the benefits of self-driving cars, flower-picking robots, or automated music transcription. For good reason, both aspects are very present in current discourse. In creative and cultural contexts, the very fact of an AI seems to dominate public and critical reception of a given work. Reviews of new AI-involving work of all kinds tend to focus on the perceived challenge to or automatization of humanness in general or authoriality in particular, rather than the ways in which human creativity might be extended. Critical and theoretical consideration of AI-involving work thus becomes unhelpfully separate from broader discussion of creative and cultural trends. In this chapter I will consider aspects of the potential role of AI in music performance in order to propose an alternative paradigm of AI as many-layered memory. Together, musician and AI seek instances of anamnesis which neither could accomplish alone. A practically oriented thought experiment explores possibilities for interface and navigation in such a performance system and creative practice. Hopefully the practical challenges will illuminate the broader issues.},

@article{Impett_21976,
 abstract = {As the relevance and utility of compositional models and techniques derived from existing music theory seemed to some composers to be dissolving at the end of the nineteenth century, they turned to other sources for paradigms of musical thought. Mahler effectively turned to phonography, as did Ives. Schönberg could be seen as having turned to symbolic logic, the kind of thinking being developed by Russell, Frege and then the Vienna Circle. One approach is more empiricist, the other more formalist, to use Badiou’s characterisation (Badiou 2007, 11). In neither case is the ‘model’ used literally; what we often see in music and sound is mimesis of the mimetic technique.  New models of morphology and geometry are fundamental to the transformation of materials in Varèse; lines become surfaces, changing perspective as the move through space. },

 abstract = {This chapter has two modest points to make. First, that the very notion of ‘early music’ tends
to distract its practitioners from the need to engage critically with the present, and that such
engagement is complicated precisely by its historical positioning. And second – more
speculatively, perhaps – that ours is a moment of epochal re-orientation in terms of global
history and cultures, and that this presents both challenges and opportunities for the current
practices of early music.},

@misc{Impett_22712,
 abstract = {This work expands the moment in time represented in Tintoretto’s  painting, La gara tra Apollo e Marsia (c.1545). Apollo, playing a viola da braccio with sympathetic strings, has been chal¬lenged by the satyr Marsia, playing a long wind instrument, to see who is the greater musician. Based on Ovid’s Metamorphoses Apollo will win, but in the moment depicted the two protago¬nists are waiting for the judgement of King Midas. 
Apollo e Marsia is an installation con¬sisting of two large screens displaying performances of compositions for viola d’amore and alto flute in changing patterns of fragments. The viola sound is processed through two long tubes, the flute through two long strings as their performances modu¬late each other. In addition, both are constantly listening to each other and to changing sounds in the room through machine learning networks, generating new memories that may predict, remind or surprise. 
The piece is therefore a play on the nonlinearity of memory under stress; moments are recalled, replayed or intrude, but are always changing in their recon¬struction. Apollo and Marsia listen to each other, trying to second-guess the other’s memory. At their root, these sonic memories all derive from two hymns to Apollo inscribed in stone at the temple dedicated to him in Delphi. Arguably the earliest remain¬ing instances of music notation, and likewise fragmented by erasures, these hymns embody partially-lost memory that we attempt to reconstruct.
