 abstract = {This chapter has two modest points to make. First, that the very notion of ‘early music’ tends
to distract its practitioners from the need to engage critically with the present, and that such
engagement is complicated precisely by its historical positioning. And second – more
speculatively, perhaps – that ours is a moment of epochal re-orientation in terms of global
history and cultures, and that this presents both challenges and opportunities for the current
practices of early music.},
