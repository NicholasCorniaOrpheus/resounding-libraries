 abstract = {Of the post-war, post-serialist generation of European composers, it was Luigi Nono who succeeded not only in identifying and addressing aesthetic and technical questions of his time, but in showing a way ahead to a new condition of music in the twenty-first century. His music has found a listenership beyond the ageing constituency of contemporary music. In Nonos work, the audiences of sound art, improvisation, electronic, experimental and radical musics of many kinds find common cause with those concerned with the renewal of Western art music. His work explores the individually and socially transformative role of music; its relationship with history and with language; the nature of the musical work as distributed through text, time, technology and individuals; the nature and performativity of the act of composition; and, above all, the role and nature of listening as a cultural activity. In many respects his music anticipates the new technological state of culture of the twenty-first century while radically reconnecting with our past. His work is itself a case study in the evolution of musical activity and the musical object: from the period of an apparently stable place for art music in Western culture to its manifold new states in our century. Routledge Handbook to Luigi Nono and Musical Thought seeks to trace the evolution of Nonos musical thought through detailed examination of the vast body of sketches, and to situate this narrative in its personal, cultural and political contexts.},

 abstract = {Setting out from an eighteenth-century portrait of ‘virtuosis’, this chapter considers how some historical understandings of the notion of virtuosity might inform a relevant contemporary concept. A view based on pure technique or charlatanism has been criticised as banal almost since the term ‘virtuoso’ has been understood principally to refer to a musical performer. Instead, we attempt to synthesise a new formulation derived from usage in art history and the natural sciences, as well as notions of virtue from historical and recent philosophy; virtuosi might be seen as explorers, as plotting paths to ‘speculative knowledge’. While technique remains an important vehicle, cultural vision and social empathy are shown to be crucial, particularly in a moment of fragmentation such as our own. The expertise most crucial to the contemporary virtuoso is that of understanding, articulating and performing new potentialities that inhere in a particular moment and space.},

 abstract = {Responses to AI vacillate between the epochal or post-human – Stephen Hawking foresees a tipping point when AI becomes able to set its own goals – and the thoroughly prosaic – the benefits of self-driving cars, flower-picking robots, or automated music transcription. For good reason, both aspects are very present in current discourse. In creative and cultural contexts, the very fact of an AI seems to dominate public and critical reception of a given work. Reviews of new AI-involving work of all kinds tend to focus on the perceived challenge to or automatization of humanness in general or authoriality in particular, rather than the ways in which human creativity might be extended. Critical and theoretical consideration of AI-involving work thus becomes unhelpfully separate from broader discussion of creative and cultural trends. In this chapter I will consider aspects of the potential role of AI in music performance in order to propose an alternative paradigm of AI as many-layered memory. Together, musician and AI seek instances of anamnesis which neither could accomplish alone. A practically oriented thought experiment explores possibilities for interface and navigation in such a performance system and creative practice. Hopefully the practical challenges will illuminate the broader issues.},

@article{Impett_21976,
 abstract = {As the relevance and utility of compositional models and techniques derived from existing music theory seemed to some composers to be dissolving at the end of the nineteenth century, they turned to other sources for paradigms of musical thought. Mahler effectively turned to phonography, as did Ives. Schönberg could be seen as having turned to symbolic logic, the kind of thinking being developed by Russell, Frege and then the Vienna Circle. One approach is more empiricist, the other more formalist, to use Badiou’s characterisation (Badiou 2007, 11). In neither case is the ‘model’ used literally; what we often see in music and sound is mimesis of the mimetic technique.  New models of morphology and geometry are fundamental to the transformation of materials in Varèse; lines become surfaces, changing perspective as the move through space. },

to distract its practitioners from the need to engage critically with the present, and that such

@misc{Impett_22712,
 abstract = {This work expands the moment in time represented in Tintoretto’s  painting, La gara tra Apollo e Marsia (c.1545). Apollo, playing a viola da braccio with sympathetic strings, has been chal¬lenged by the satyr Marsia, playing a long wind instrument, to see who is the greater musician. Based on Ovid’s Metamorphoses Apollo will win, but in the moment depicted the two protago¬nists are waiting for the judgement of King Midas. 
Apollo e Marsia is an installation con¬sisting of two large screens displaying performances of compositions for viola d’amore and alto flute in changing patterns of fragments. The viola sound is processed through two long tubes, the flute through two long strings as their performances modu¬late each other. In addition, both are constantly listening to each other and to changing sounds in the room through machine learning networks, generating new memories that may predict, remind or surprise. 
The piece is therefore a play on the nonlinearity of memory under stress; moments are recalled, replayed or intrude, but are always changing in their recon¬struction. Apollo and Marsia listen to each other, trying to second-guess the other’s memory. At their root, these sonic memories all derive from two hymns to Apollo inscribed in stone at the temple dedicated to him in Delphi. Arguably the earliest remain¬ing instances of music notation, and likewise fragmented by erasures, these hymns embody partially-lost memory that we attempt to reconstruct.

@article{Dantas_22031,
 abstract = {Throughout this review, I will explore the impact of Smolicki’s questions through some of the texts contained in this book, with the support of a handful of its important references – mainly Dylan Robinson (2020), Val Plumwood (1995) and Sara Ahmed (2006). Before proceeding, I need to take a closer look at the aforementioned questions in order to establish my orientation marks, the themes that will loosely anchor this review. First, I am interested in understanding how soundwalking can be deployed as a technique or a condition “for disrupting the familiar.” That initial investigation will then allow me to consider the aims towards which this technique could be deployed, i.e., “familiarizing with the unknown” and “reconfiguring how we sense and act in the world today.” If the hypothesis implied in Smolicki’s questions holds, namely, if soundwalking can, in fact, be considered as a method to help us actualize the recurring metaphor of listening as an “openness to the exterior world to take input and be disturbed” (Droumeva, p. 80), and if said disturbances can indeed reconfigure how we sense and act in the world, then soundwalking might be considered a tool in service of a wider ethical program, one that facilitates a better attunement “to the particular filters of race, class, gender, and ability that actively select and frame the moment of contact between the listening body and the listened-to sound” and a “listening otherwise” (Robinson, p. 11) oriented towards social and environmental justice.},

Departing from a free reflection regarding the idea of presence in field recordings, developed around texts by Mark Peter Wright, Salomé Voegelin, Tullis Rennie and Isobel Anderson, there follows an analysis and elaborations on excerpts of original interviews and conversations with Cristovam and Fenerich, taking into account their particular narratives regarding the process of creation of such works as Duas Estórias Domésticas Colapsadas and Coleção Peripatética de Sons. This approach reveals uses of field recordings particular to these authors: Cristovam is very much aware of his presence in his recordings, even in those that are characterised by the absence of any sound of an anthropic origin. And Fenerich seems to have found a method in the wandering: there are not, necessarily, projects that are already conceived and that determine a systematic in his outings with the aim of recording. These projects could be discovered during or even after the act of recording.},

 abstract = {In this presentation I will reflect on experiences that prompted me to reassess some aspects of my field recording activities. Those experiences are related to the recording sessions for Cidade Arquipélago (2015), an album predominantly featuring binaural field recordings produced in Japan, conducted between 2014-15. My subsequent 2023 research in Tokyo was motivated by the realisation that many of the album's recordings presented sonic situations commonly explored by other sound artists, potentially contributing to a stereotypical portrayal of ‘Japanese (sonic) culture’. Dissatisfied, I resolved to revisit the original recording sites, focusing not on a perceived ‘Japanesenes’ of events, but on personal memories associated with the 2014-15 recordings. The 2023 recording sessions were marked by disappointment, overshadowed by the memory of the original recordings. Consequently, I shifted focus towards exploring presence, routines, and the repetitive nature of everyday life. This led my research to gradually delve into 'sound routines' found in Tokyo, providing a means to immerse in the city's rhythms through auditory experiences. A handful of sound works emerged, documenting routine phenomena by overlaying multiple recordings of the same recurring situations, while moving away from a singular focus on 'culturally symbolic' sounds. Additionally, certain sound events served as scores for electronic instruments developed during the creative process.},

From within the Tatekawa, the expressway’s intense activity and maintenance work are audible. On quieter days, with the use of filters, some species adapting to these changes can still be heard. These recordings layer different times and speeds in the urban “now”: the natural rivers, now channeled, and their modern counterparts—the expressways immortalized by Tarkovsky and Oshii.

@article{Parra_Cancino_21971,
 abstract = {This paper redefines the performance practice of street barrel organs by transcending their conventional physical gestures beyond their role as mere music reproduction machines. We propose a new understanding of these instruments by establishing a parallel with how turntables started to be considered musical instruments through hand manipulation. Collaborating with Chilean 'organilleros', we experimented with the notion of ‘physical gesture transgression’ and explored creating new sounds through various body actions. We provide a list of ‘transgressive gestures,’ proposing expansions through instrument preparation or additional gestures, and how these new gestures can be annotated alongside traditional notation for other musical instruments.

@book{Parra_Cancino_22682,
 abstract = {In this paper, we present a device that implements a ring modulator intended to recreate historical analog audio. As simple as it sounds, the multiplication of two analog audio signals is not a straightforward task, mainly due to phenomena such as saturation or non-linearity. Drawing inspiration from historical realizations of ring modulation, we experimented with the most common methods described in the literature. Our device, which is comparatively inexpensive, improves upon the aforementioned alternatives from a DIY perspective. It is predominantly analog, adhering to the practices of the first decades of electroacoustic music, with the notable exception of the digital control for the sinusoidal carrier. We aim to strike a balance between analog audio technology and modern components and techniques. Additionally, this paper includes audiovisual demonstrations that showcase the practical uses of our ring modulator. A comprehensive GitHub repository provides open access to all the resources required for DIY enthusiasts to replicate our implementation},
