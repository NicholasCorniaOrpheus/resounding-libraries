 abstract = {The meteoric surge of AI-generated music has prompted significant concerns among artists and publishers alike. Some fear that the adoption of AI is poised to result in massive job destruction; others sense it will jeopardize and eventually upend all legal frameworks of intellectual property. AI, however, is not the first instance where humanity has confronted the prospect of machines emulating musical creativity. Already in the Baroque, various modes of musical artificiality were explored, ranging from automata and organ stops mimicking human performance and natural sounds, up to devices for mechanized composition (e.g., Athanasius Kircher, Johann Philip Kirnberger, C.P.E. Bach, Antonio Calegari and Diederich Nickolaus Winkel). Valuable insights emerge from the reconsideration—and digital implementation—of these curiosities through the lens of present-day generative models. It can be argued that the very notion of ‘artificiality’ has presented humanity with long-standing philosophical dilemmas, in addressing the debate on the role of art as a substitute of (divine) nature. By digitally implementing and formalizing some pioneering instances of algorithmically generated music we wish to illustrate how mechanical devices have played a role in human art and entertainment prior to our digital era.},

This text contextualises the game within the experiences of the authors, researchers at Orpheus Instituut,  who have been engaged in creating explorative spaces for new types of collaboration, using the principles of playfulness. Through a combination of artistic and theoretical work and practical experience with iterative case studies in which game mechanics are tested, refined, and tested again, the authors are engaged in a process of discovery within a “magic circle”. Open-ended experimentation and collaboration are central areas of focus. Failure is re-conceived as a learning process and its catastrophic effects are integrated into the make-believe space of the game, while the insights and experiences drawn from these failures are retained once we step out of the magic circle.},

 abstract = {Despite recent cultural changes, the Early Music movement remains mostly a bastion of "truth" and "authenticity" in modern times' turbulent sea of doubt. Conversely, the whirlpool of artifice project wishes to legitimize a place for falsification, fiction and imagination in the realm of historically informed practice. The hermetic title A Whirlpool of Imaginary Sounds embeds in itself the main premises of the project. First, it alludes to Italian philosopher Giulio Camillo (1480-1544), who proposed a device called artificiosa routa, a generative model ante litteram to systematize the creative process of poets and orators. Analogously with Camillo and many transgressive thinkers of the 16th and early 17th century, the project wishes to investigate the plurality of worlds hidden behind the (re)combinations of a musical knowledge system. Secondly, it is an homage to writers of fiction and thinkers like Jorge Luis Borges and Umberto Eco. Mythical creatures as well as utopian lands share a similar ascendant on our minds: through placing themselves outside reality they become powerful emblems revealing the inner meaning of things. Inspired by proto-scientific thought, poetry, devices of wonder and games from the 16th and early 17th centuries the Whirlpool of Imaginary Sounds aims to reconsider our past through polyphonic music that never was. In this project, I aspire to discover the liminal space between corpus-based musicking, forgery and period composition by reshaping the role of knowledge, either actual or imaginary, and its systematization.},

 abstract = {On 6 December 2006, students of the Royal Conservatoire of Brussels performed two one-act pasticci arranged by the author of this article: Ifigenia and Ipermestra. Assembled by the author of this article as experiments in the young discipline of artistic research in music, both ‘cut & paste’ operas offered opportunities to explore issues of music-dramatic syntax in opera seria. In the article, I explain how individual arias and recitatives were combined into two meta-compositions that sometimes respected, and sometimes overrode the eighteenth-century generic conventions. By revisiting the scores, libretti, archives and first-hand memories pertaining to this venture, I show that ‘pastiching’ (pasticciare) is more than a historical form; it is a transhistorical method, involving a broad network of agencies, operators, and stakeholders whose strategies can be artistic and non-artistic, convergent and divergent. Pastiching does not necessarily result in ‘works’, fixed in time and space, but rather produces meta-compositional assemblages, the transience and formal instability of which provide opportunities to showcase neglected repertoire and tackle outdated musical ontologies.},

@incollection{Forment_21909,
 abstract = {Those who would like to gain an unbiased idea of Gilson’s skills as operatic composer are out of luck: to date, there does not exist a decent, commercially available recording of Prinses Zonneschijn (‘Princess Sunshine’), the composer’s acknowledged masterpiece in the genre. For want of more reliable auditive sources, one has to content oneself with two incomplete radio recordings from the VRT archives: one of the first act from 1965, conducted by Daniel Sternefeld and supplemented with a disturbing voice-over; and a live recording of a performance with cuts from 1983. A decent edition of the orchestral score might bring solace, but this is not available either; Gilson’s autograph has disappeared without a trace. Fortunately, the library of the Opera Ballet Vlaanderen preserves a series of hitherto ignored treasures: a vocal score in Gilson’s hand; an orchestral score produced by a copyist and annotated in various hands; a complete set of orchestral parts; an annotated libretto with stage directions; and a Repetiteur, being a vocal score in Gilson’s hand with stage directions by the librettist, Pol de Mont.
	In this essay, we use these and other sources, such as correspondence, iconographic material, archival records and reviews, as raw materials for an archaeological study of Gilson’s opera. Without offering definitive answers to the question whether or not Prinses Zonneschijn constitutes a forgotten masterpiece or an overblown artefact of the Flemish movement, we consider the piece as a multidisciplinary work of art that was produced by different operators: in addition to the composer and librettist, a widely branched, dynamic and anything but unanimous network of directors, set designers, performers, patrons, critics, ... Rereading all these voices and driving forces leads to fresh insights into the underlying stylistic choices of De Mont and Gilson. It also allows us to recognise different layers of meaning in a rich soil of evidence. 
A first layer pertains to the opera’s genesis: the historical antecedents of De Mont’s libretto and Gilson’s score, both of which are rich in intertextualisms. In the period preceding the creation, De Mont made his way from student environments to the first plan of the Flemish movement. He did pioneering work in folklore, created a fiercely appreciated poetic oeuvre, turned out to be a pangermanist, occasional director and art historian, and was also a driving force in the establishment of the Vlaamse Opera. Prinses Zonneschijn was therefore De Mont’s project in the first place, and Gilson’s to a much lesser extent. The composer, however, coloured De Mont’s story with such an idiosyncratic musical idiom that Prinses Zonneschijn gradually became his opera. 
Between the Antwerp creation, the French-language production at La Monnaie and the renewed production at the recently completed Vlaamse Opera, the characters of De Mont and Gilson were not only increasingly placed on an equal footing; their artistic collaboration was also enriched in an essential way by the insights of other artists, such as the set designer Albert Dubosq. In that short period, the Princess grew into a symbolist Gesamtkunstwerk, which today can be documented by means of (annotated) libretti, scores, staging manuals, and photographs. 
The genetic and performative layers generated the sediment for the third layer, laid down between 1907 and 1983: the period in which a flawless, audiovisual fairy tale generated significant resonance, but gradually deteriorated into a vague memory of Flamingantism. Unable to withstand modern opera insights, the Princess silently disappeared from the repertoire, waiting for a new awakening.

 abstract = {Once a term from winemaking and a synonym of high quality, now a standard epithet of any object that is sought after on account of its rarity, unicity, or antiquity, ‘vintage’ has sparked (sub)cultures, industries, and communities. In music, vintage refers mostly to instruments or apparatuses that, after a period of obsolescence, are being rediscovered, revalued, reproduced, or revamped—electric guitars, effects pedals, analogue synthesisers, drum machines, amplifiers, recording equipment, sound carriers, etc. The scope, appeal, and user groups of vintage gear are becoming wider by the day. Aesthetically speaking, vintage materialities are defining the sound and look of multiple styles of music, just as harpsichords, gut-stringed violins, and valveless trumpets are characterising ‘early music.’ However, vintage materialities in music transcend issues of historically informed performance, and they confront artists and scholars with unanswered questions: On what grounds can obsolete technologies for music production and performance become desirable again in an era of high-tech, across different genres, and in both the professional and amateur spheres? In what ways do vintage materialities and their technical affordances mediate or challenge present-day creative and performative practices? How do vintage materialities respond to cultures, discourses, politics, and economies of, among others, retro style, nostalgia, afro- and retrofuturism, and lo-fi?},

 abstract = {The challenges and limits for musicians dealing with texts.

To perform a musical score implies the transformation of a symbolically coded text into vibrant sound. In Performing by the Book? a carefully selected cadre of artist-researchers dissects this delicate act in critical ways. Offering first-hand insights into the notational, structural and interpretative challenges faced by musicians in dealing with texts of all kinds, the chapters traverse the spectrum between the Middle Ages and the age of Stockhausen. In a harmonious blend of scholarly allure and individual artistry, free from academic obfuscation, the contributors keep a keen eye on the limits of interpretation, both in terms of the interpretative process itself and of the balance between textual faithfulness and artistic autonomy. This comprehensive volume is an indispensable guide for everyone interested in the relationship between musical performance and texts.

While the concept of ‘storytelling’ to convey the full narrative of early music from score to performance is undoubtedly a positive strategy for bridging research with performance and audience engagement, it requires substantial (often unpaid) effort.

Nevertheless, examples demonstrate that researchers and performers of early music have significantly enhanced their efficiency and adeptly embraced the role of ‘storytellers.’ Moreover, technological advancements have made storytelling tools more affordable and user-friendly.

 abstract = {This paper explores the remarkable scenographic legacy of Albert Dubosq, a prolific painter-decorator whose career encompassed over 466 theatrical productions across Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Austria-Hungary, and the UK. Unlike many of his peers, Dubosq left behind a unique and tangible corpus: a vast collection of full-scale stage sets preserved in Courtrai, Belgium, and over 800 maquette elements rediscovered in Grenoble. These materials reveal Dubosq’s vibrant pleinairist aesthetic and innovative responses to the evolving stage technologies of the fin-de-siècle.

This presentation examines Dubosq’s collaborative workshop model, stylistic lineage, and iconographic strategies—foregrounding his adaptation of scenic topoi to support operatic and dramatic repertories. His preserved works challenge assumptions that early 20th-century scenic practice has vanished beyond study. Instead, they offer insight into performance conventions, painterly methods, and repertory logic in the era of electric lighting and increasing visual sophistication. Dubosq’s scenic designs for operas such as Aida, Lakmé, and La Bohème demonstrate a deep fidelity to original stage directions while illuminating his personal style rooted in the light and color theories of Impressionism.

Ultimately, this research responds to the call of Mercedes Viale Ferrero for a historical iconographia theatralis: a theatrical visual lexicon linking dramaturgy, scenography, and audience memory.},

Their repertoires—ranging from Peter Benoit to Bizet—reflected a city navigating between Flemish cultural revival and French refinement. The annual travelling theatre fair drew large crowds, much to the dismay of Catholic and Flemish-nationalist circles, who fostered their own artistic platforms in groups like Vlaamsche Zonen. Around 1903, the city intervened: theatre became a public concern, culminating in the construction of a new City Theatre in neo-Flemish style.
