To achieve this, current issues of interoperability within the discipline’s state-of-the-art are first identified. Next, a new virtual ontology of the interoperable metaverse is proposed, inspired by recent developments in assemblage theory and in specific concepts by Gilles Deleuze, Manuel DeLanda, and Paulo de Assis. In the third and fourth parts of this paper, a new technical solution is presented: a taxonomy of Periodic Spacetime Sequences, devised for practical implementation of a new distributed version control system. This solution could offer an innovative framework for the interoperable metaverse, which could be built using the proposed taxonomy.},

ENG: 
The advisory working group on Artificial Intelligence was appointed by the Minister of Education and Sciences of the Republic of Poland. This group includes members from various sectors: state (Ministry of Education and Sciences), commercial (Microsoft, Google), research (Institute for Educational Research, IBE), and educational organisations. This is a second guide in a series aimed at teachers, focusing on the integration of Artificial Intelligence in educational settings. This guide has been disseminated across Polish educational institutions at all levels through a state-managed digital educational platform.

PL:

Przedstawiamy kolejny przewodnik dla nauczycieli przygotowany przez Ministerstwo Edukacji i Nauki. W publikacji zastanawiamy się nad kreatywnością dużych modeli językowych.
W poradniku „Chat GPT w szkole. Szanse i zagrożenia” odpowiadaliśmy na pytania dotyczące istoty sztucznej inteligencji i jej zastosowań w edukacji. Omawialiśmy szczegółowo narzędzia wykorzystujące sztuczną inteligencję, przedstawiliśmy ChatGPT i analizowaliśmy jego wpływ na proces nauczania. Dodatkowo zwróciliśmy uwagę na kluczowe elementy pracy pedagogicznej z wykorzystaniem bota.

Wyzwania dla współczesnej szkoły
Od tego czasu wiele się zmieniło w związku z dynamicznym rozwojem zaawansowanych modeli językowych. Dlatego też postanowiliśmy wydać kolejny poradnik „Do czego AI nie służy” skupiający się na modelach językowych. Dokument ten wychodzi naprzeciw zmieniającej się rzeczywistości i potrzebom edukacyjnym.

W dzisiejszym świecie jedyną stałą wydaje się nieustanna zmiana. Kompetencje, które nabywamy w szkole i życiu dorosłym, dezaktualizują szybciej niż kiedykolwiek wcześniej. Zjawisko to wynika z gigantycznego przyrostu nowych informacji w krótkim czasie. Stąd też naszym celem jest zrozumienie, które kompetencje stają się kluczowe w kontekście szybko zmieniających się realiów edukacyjnych.

Sztuczna inteligencja a kreatywność
Według modelu 4K kluczowymi umiejętnościami są: kreatywność, komunikacja, krytyczne myślenie i kooperacja. Kreatywność była dotychczas uznawana za kompetencję typowo ludzką, ale jej definicja, w związku z rozwojem badań nad generatywną sztuczną inteligencją, znów staje się przedmiotem debaty, również w kontekście edukacyjnym.

W przewodniku „Do czego AI nie służy” zastanawiamy się nad kreatywnością dużych modeli językowych, analizujemy etyczno-moralne aspekty korzystania z nich oraz prezentujemy wskazówki dla nauczycieli. Ostatni rozdział skupia się na przykładach niepożądanych zachowań użytkowników AI w szkole oraz definiuje zagrożenia związane z wdrażaniem rozwiązań AI w edukacji.},

@incollection{Łukawski_22714,
 abstract = {This chapter introduces two new concepts: ‘Decentralized Creative Networks’ and ‘Performative Transactions’. Decentralized Creative Networks are envisioned as blockchain-based post-human social networks, in which artists and AI agents develop and transact composable artistic processes, transparently building upon each other’s interoperable contributions. These processes are shared in Decentralized Creative Networks like social media posts. Artists can use them to shape their artistic work, by making it dependent on the execution of processes created by other artists and AI agents (for instance to compose music, to execute live performances of an artistic work, or to generate non-fungible tokens). Performative Transaction is a kind of transaction specific to these networks. It is executed by a smart contract, the code of which specifies both the artistic process and the terms of referencing it by other processes. To ensure interoperability, artistic processes in the system are composed as recursive patterns of transformations in a framework inspired by the Transformational Theory of David Lewin and Machine Learning’s feature engineering. When interlinked Performative Transactions are executed, smart contracts carry out all referenced musical transformations contributing to the musical result. They also automatically distribute any financial receivables to the creators of all referenced artistic processes. Furthermore, the integration of Artificial Intelligence within Decentralized Creative Networks is discussed, suggesting a collaborative framework where human and AI agents interact, actively shaping the artistic network. These interactions are further elucidated on the examples of music composition, performance, analysis, and sound synthesis, demonstrating the versatility of Performative Transactions for musical use cases. While recognizing the potential of Decentralized Creative Networks, the chapter acknowledges current challenges for their development. Overcoming these challenges could significantly impact how art is created, shared, and experienced in the digital era.},

@phdthesis{Jauhiainen_22786,
 abstract = {The research examines the potentiality of emergence and environmental intelligence as a compositional and performative tool. It focuses on a de/reterritorialization process that – to borrow from Deleuzian terminology – is becoming-environment of music and becoming-music of an environment. The key questions are: how could environmental intelligence – an integration of environmental data and knowledge with artificial intelligence (AI) – be applied as a compositional system for generative music? And how could environmentally sensitive and responsive music operate in the age of accelerated environmental change and ever-ubiquitous intelligent technology?

Drawing from Assemblage Theory, Hyperobjects, New Materialism and Posthumanism, the research seeks to formulate a new 21st century musical practice and aesthetic as that of a constructive agency between environment, music, technology and philosophy; to posit an idea of composer/performer as a facilitator – philosopher, gardener, catalyst – between contemporary society, science and sonic arts. It aims to develop an ecosystemic approach to 'AI in music' where AI operates as one of the agents in a greater ecology of human and more-than-human intelligences. The focus is on generative (self-organising and -evolving) musical practices that cover electroacoustic and contemporary classical music, new global musical styles as well as the emerging possibilities and combinations of music and sound art.

Alongside written theoretical work and a series of compositions and performances, the practice-based research consists of developing an AI application (‘Terrestrial’) that will act as an intelligent algorithmic tool between the composer/performer and a given environment (e.g. an ecosystem, hyperobject, network or assemblage) – actual or virtual.},

 abstract = {Title of the book for review: Luciano Berio and the Philosophy of Language. An Investigation on the Music-Language Problem
Following the proclaimed crisis of tonal music’s “vocabulary” in the first half of the twentieth century, many composers – following Arnold Schoenberg’s innovations - felt the need to fund a new musical language. In pursuit of this project, however, the protagonists of the new serial music, gathered around the Darmstadt School, found themselves facing a number of contradictions (e.g. hyperstructuralism of serial music vs. lack of systemacity and organicity). This led to intense debate on the possibility of a new musical language and, more in general, on music’s status as a language. Luciano Berio's role in this debate is central. Starting from his experience as a musician and supported by a theoretical awareness of the contemporary philosophy of language, the composer wonders about the possibility of inventing a new language (and, in general, of using music as language) by elaborating answers that not only shed light on the nature of music itself, but also illuminate some aspects of verbal language. The reader will find in Berio’s reflections an unusual, yet rigorous, point of view on the music-language question. },

 abstract = {This little book is not a dictionary in the accepted sense of the word – although it is nonetheless reassuring, mind you! It is an almanac. An almanac (from the Arabic المنحة al-minḥa oder المنح al manḥ, meaning ‘gift,’ or ‘present’) was some kind of early calendar, a collection of texts and hints at the positions of planets, sunrise and sundown, etc. Our almanac is ‘astronomical’ in such a way, that it presents a very personal and playful astronomy. It gives a collection of ‘sound words’ that have figured as the individual guiding-stars for the participating sound artists and scholars, guiding-stars perceived from various positions and locations on this planet. Unlike volumes announcing ‘Keywords of ….’ Or ‘Key Concepts of …,’ these heavyweights – even heavyweight champions!) that operate with all the tricks of the trade, with combinations of punches, jabs, even liver shots, this almanac follows a more humble approach, minor, an intimate tai-chi, rather. So, instead of a reassuring dictionary, with grand definitions that promise stability over time and space, here we have an unstable, personal, and playful almanac, that is reassuring not by rational argumentation, but by lived example. John Cage’s wish for mankind was ‘Happy New Ears.’ Maybe, with this almanac, we can be inspired to listening differently.},

 abstract = {Sound of Democracy—How everyday sound environments support, reflect and deflect democratic values.
Through the use of sound this project investigates democratic values, and their manifestation in sound environments. Research on democracy investigates questions such as: How is power allocated between different actors? or How is expert knowledge democratized? We will examine everyday examples of how this allocation and democratization works. Sound is an inevitable consequence of actions and relations in our world, and all spaces have an acoustic element to them. At the same time, questions of democracy in relation to everyday life—inclusion in, access to, equality of— play out across society in legislation, sustainable development, higher education and academic freedom. In terms of actual results of democratic goals, sound has a particularly disobedient quality—it does not obey visual, legal or ownership borders. The theme’s main research question is how everyday sound environments support, reflect and deflect democratic values. Everyday effects, and use of sound, dissolve and disrespect disciplinary boundaries where sound is forming its own territory and rules. Through our investigations it will be possible to identify Sonic Actants (types, roles) and Ambiguous Sounds in order to achieve an understanding of various sounds, and their surrounding situations connected to democratic values. Artistic research holds a methodological potential that crosses disciplinary boundaries, this will be used through introducing kaleidoscopic hearing that activates an ‘intense empathy’, and can thereby interrogate democratic values in an immediate sense through an emotional response to the question: What does this sound make me feel? This involves forming new knowledge on how sound, and its uses, may be democratized. In this project, sound is both involved as the key theoretical component and as a methodological element that crosses boundaries through experimental and collective perception of sound environments, this will contribute to the discussion and visibility of structures of equality, justice and inclusion.},

 abstract = {Mario Bertoncini’s Spazio-Tempo (1970): Reading between the lines of an unwritable score
The theatrical-installative work Spazio-Tempo (1970) by the Italian composer Mario Bertoncini (Rome, 1932 – Siena, 2019) offers us the occasion to explore “the positive function of notation” within the creative process, as presented by Emily Payne and Floris Schuiling. Payne and Schuiling understand notation “not as the representation of an abstract structure but as a concrete material object, in order to move beyond a paradigm that opposes notated permanence to performed and/or improvised transience.” Thus, using the case of Spazio-Tempo, I will explore the creative process and scoring materials through an examination of both the work’s written traces and its unwritten practices. In the case of Bertoncini and Spazio-Tempo, these unwritten practices are to be found in the knowledge and exercises developed and embodied by Bertoncini as a member of the Rome-based improvisation collective Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza (GINC from now on), in which Bertoncini participated from 1965. In particular, I will discuss whether these unwritten elements of GINC’s improvisation practice at the time–the development of which relies heavily on Bertoncini’s input–percolated into Bertoncini’s personal creative process, whether they have prescriptive power, and whether they can fill the gaps present between the lines of the written scoring materials of Spazio-Tempo.
This article appropriates Payne and Schuiling’s questions as the most cogent framing through which Spazio-Tempo can be understood: “Is it possible to describe how scores can function as sources of creative knowledge for performers, while avoiding the discourse of ‘reproduction’[…]? Moreover, can notation be understood not just as an object of cognition, but as an integral element of the forms of social and creative interactions that are now seen to characterize performance?” Or, more specifically: to what extent does collective improvisation practice ripple into individual composition practice? And how can we use the knowledge developed in this collective practice to navigate a notational environment usually described as “indeterminate”? Through a close reading of the archival materials and the use of the embodied knowledge Bertoncini developed while participating in the GINC, I will argue that, instead of wondering what actions Bertoncini expected the instrumentalists to produce, we should ask what skills he expected them to have.},

 abstract = {Luigi Nono's ...sofferte onde serene... (1976-77) initiates a profound transformation in his compositional strategies, shifting from overt political messages to more nuanced explorations of sound. Focusing solely on one instrument, and recalibrating his compositional techniques, Nono took this piece as an opportunity to reconsider his musical thought and to deeply rethink the act of listening. Scrutinising this transformation from a musical perspective, this essay highlights Nono's renewed engagement with canonical and variation techniques taught by his early mentors Scherchen and Maderna, while also discussing the seamless integration of live and electronic sounds. Taking Nono's redefined musical language as an appeal to rethink listening as a critical process, this paper asserts the political potency of Nono's late style, suggesting that attentive listening is a political act, urging a reconsideration of musical engagement and the ethos of listening in a turbulent world.},

@incollection{Assis_22724,
 abstract = {The practice of music - be it its composition, interpretation, performance, or listening - is deeply intertwined with the medium through which it is generated, transmitted, and preserved. Historically, music rooted in oral traditions relied heavily on human memory, passing down nuances through generations without the need for written notation. The advent of musical scores marked a shift, envisioning music as a textual entity that could be inscribed, interpreted, and realized in various forms. With the introduction of recordings, music assumed the character of fixed time-bound segments, capturing and preserving sonic events as permanent artifacts. The digital era further transformed music into retrievable data, subject to computational analysis and rendering, managed by specialists in digital humanities. In this evolving landscape, blockchain technologies have the potential to offer yet a new profound redefinition of music, portraying it as a constellation of infinite particles. This new medium facilitates not only human interaction but also algorithmic and computational participation, allowing for endless recombinations and creations in the musical landscape. This evolution of mediums reflects an ongoing redefinition of what music is and can be, with blockchain opening new horizons for understanding and creating music.},

 abstract = {This doctoral proposal embarks on an artistic research project aimed at the development and refinement of my transdisciplinary compositional practice, with a distinct focus on exploring non-anthropocentric approaches to the creation of musical and multimedia works.

The overarching objective is to transcend conventional paradigms that centre human beings as the main characters in musical performances, exploring alternative conceptualisations of artistic expression that prioritise interconnectedness with the broader ecological fabric.
Grounded in ecological theories, biological imagination, and posthuman philosophies, this research seeks to develop new modes of art-making that engage with and reflect upon the agency of non-human entities and natural processes.

This research endeavour will contribute to the emergence of new compositional languages that challenge anthropocentric norms, offering a fresh perspective on the role of the composer/director in artistic collective processes and on the transformative potential of non-anthropocentric musical practices.},
