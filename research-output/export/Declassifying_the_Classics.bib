It traces the lifelong friendship between the two artists and their shared activities in building the Beethoven myth. Czerny’s additions in his early piano versions of Beethoven’s violin sonata op. 47 "Kreutzer" suggest that Liszt might have adopted and incorporated Czernyian teachings still rooted in 18th century performance practice in his Beethoven performances (often criticized as too free or wayward) rather than merely indulging in personal romantic exuberance.},

 abstract = {C. P. E. Bach’s fabled Silbermann clavichord is perhaps his best-known instrument, but another deserves consideration for its impact on his musical output: a clavichord by Friederici. At this newer instrument, Bach composed his nearly twenty years’ worth of Hamburg works. This clavichord updated Bach’s musical medium to the latest technologies, yet his older instrument was retained and still showcased to visitors. This research project seeks the significance of Bach’s Friederici clavichord and investigates how its affordances differed from those of the Silbermann. As I examine compositions by Bach and contemporaries, I will use enactment and embodiment to glean insights in Bach’s entanglements with his instruments and will engage in empirical measurements of clavichords to understand performer-instrument interaction. Deepening the understanding of the differences between two types of clavichords and their respective roles alongside the rising fortepiano will broaden the clavichord’s influence in our perception of Galant and Classical repertoire.},

The idea of a Danse Macabre as a theme fitting for a left-handed-piano-quintet came to me accidentally: one unremarkable night, having slept on my right arm until it went numb, moving it produced a strange sense that it was not my arm—a kind of “phantom limb” experience (or perhaps the reverse). The metaphor of the “phantom” seemed to me to tie together many disparate ideas related the story of the left-handed-pianist: invisibility, disability, extreme virtuosity, the “forgotten” hand, and ultimately a sort of memento mori.

The piece’s structure follows the common medieval depiction as shown in the image above (John of Kastav, Holy Trinity Church in Hrastovlje, Slovenia). Here Death, manifested as skeletons, dances with earthly characters one by one. In this piece, Death is represented by bells (an homage to Henri Cazalis’s poem, that in turn inspired the most popular of all Danses Macabres by Saint-Saëns) followed by a somewhat grotesque attempt to dance. In between each manifestation of this, there are six tableaux of living beings: the princess, the beggar, the patriot, the very busy, the dreamer, and the child. While we can very well imagine these six as medieval characters, we also know them well as contemporary stereotypes. The final tableau, a waltz, sees materials from each of the characters dancing all together, on a thin line between joy and denial, between beauty and banality.},

Karmic Songs is a set of reflections on the concepts of the soul, ghosts, and karma, inspired by Thai
folktales and Theravadin Buddhist thoughts. The first song sets Mary Oliver’s poem Bone, where, in search
for what the soul might be, the narrator finds an ear bone of a whale and contemplates on whether the
soul might look like this—the ear bone is crucial to the whale’s ability to navigate. This resonates with
how it is also the most crucial part for musicians, and is, in a way, like their “souls”. The second and third
songs set an assemblage of texts from many sources, from old Buddhist Suttas to contemporary poems
which I have borrowed and threaded together. Telling the story of a Preta or “hungry ghost”, one of the
ghosts commonly used in Thailand to scare children from misbehaving, myself affected. In this song the
ghost itself warns us, the living, of our greed and endless “wanting more and more of the earth”. The final
song is a prayer of hope, calling upon the “miracles of honesty and truth to keep the sky from falling.”

As well as the Piano Trio in A minor, the disc includes Linos’s own arrangements of Ravel’s Pavane pour une infante défunte and Le Tombeau de Couperin — an extension of their ‘Stolen Music’ project, in which they collaboratively re-imagine orchestral masterpieces as if they had been initially conceived for Piano Trio.

By using period instruments, the Linos players find a wider range of colour in Ravel’s music, and a more timbrally-entwined balance between the three instruments. Violinist Konrad Elias-Trostmann and cellist Vladimir Waltham play on a combination of plain and wound gut strings, while Pianist Prach Boondiskulchok performs on an 1882 Érard Concert Grand piano, the same make and a very similar model to the piano Ravel himself owned and composed with.

While the Pavane, composed in 1899, depicts an imagined dance in a 17th-century Spanish court and the Tombeau presents a series of neo-baroque dances, composed against the backdrop of the First World War, the Linos players have also come to see the Piano Trio as a set of dances. Completed in 1914, immediately before Ravel enlisted for military service, the Trio speaks to Le Tombeau across the historical divide of the outbreak of war in their ‘search for lost dances’: “the Piano Trio imagines dances of his childhood, dances of faraway places, dances of victory and death, while Le Tombeau reimagines dances from faraway times”.},

@book{Beghin_21856,
 abstract = {
In 1803 Beethoven acquired a French piano from the Erard Frères workshop in Paris. The composer was “so enchanted with it,” one visitor reported, “that he regards all the pianos made here as rubbish by comparison.” While Beethoven loved its sound, the touch of the French keyboard was much heavier than that of the Viennese pianos he had been used to. Hoping to overcome this drawback, he commissioned a local technician to undertake a series of revisions, with ultimately disappointing results. Beethoven set aside the Erard piano for good in 1810.
 
Beethoven’s French Piano returns the reader to this period of Beethoven’s enthusiasm for all things French. What traces of the Erard’s presence can be found in piano sonatas like his “Waldstein” and “Appassionata”? To answer this question, Tom Beghin worked with a team of historians and musicians to commission the making of an accurate replica of the Erard piano. As both a scholar and a recording artist, Beghin is uniquely positioned to guide us through this key period of Beethoven’s work. Whether buried in archives, investigating the output of the French pianists who so fascinated Beethoven, or seated at the keyboard of his Erard, Beghin thinks and feels his way into the mind of the composer, bringing startling new insights into some of the best-known piano compositions of all time. },

 note = {One of the more evocative practices of musicking during the Enlightenment was that of varying repeats—or the expectation for musicians in true oratorical style to improvise on the written text, whenever they repeat a section of a piece. This practice belonged to the realm of rhetorical “delivery” (Vortrag, pronuntiatio), but such professional skill came in conflict with a blossoming amateur market of keyboard players, for whom an ever-expanding repertoire of published scores became available, or what CPE Bach called, Handstücke, where music must first and foremost be accurately read and realized.
Addressing this conflict—while continuing a pedagogical mission that had started with his 1753 Versuch über die wahre Art das Clavier zu spielen—Bach published a first series of six Sonaten mit veränderten Reprisen Wq. 50 in 1760. These important examples of “ex tempore” variation incorporated in a fully written-out score may be compared with the improvisational prowess of the young Mozart, whose father Leopold (as evidenced in a letter of 1775, in almost certain reference to Sonatas K. 279–283) held high hopes for his son to contribute to this “new” genre of “sonata with varied reprises.”

 note = {When in 1775 Leopold Mozart inquired with Breitkopf in Leipzig whether he might like to print an opus of keyboard sonatas “in the same manner as those of H: Philipp Carl Emanuel Bach mit veränderten Reprisen,” he may have had a double motive. Not only was he pitching W. A. Mozart’s recently completed Sonatas K 279–284 (1774–75), which in the Mozart household were known as “the difficult sonatas,” but he may also have had in mind a clever way for his brilliant nineteen-year-old son to tap into a potentially lucrative amateur market. The publication did not happen, but the question is intriguing: what might such Mozart Sonatas with Varied Reprises have looked like?
            To produce such an edition makes for a challenging counterfactual exercise. It also provokes more questions. When performing classical keyboard sonatas, what happens when we submit ourselves to the expectation of continuous variation? How do we navigate the materiality of a printed score? What are the limits to incorporating our variants and at what point do we feel like starting over, and re-composing altogether? How do we tap into the 18th-century ideal of a keyboardist as composer-performer, while becoming sensitive to a musical culture that harbored a more fluent use of a musical work, tailored to the needs of a performer?
            This lecture balances these questions against an exploration of rhetorical intent behind repetition and variation, Bach’s published thoughts on the matter, and the presenter’s own experiments of teaching and performing Mozart’s sonatas on a Stein fortepiano—as the instrument that in 1777 became crucial in the professional life of a maturing improviser and composer.

This lecture-recital, featuring Tom Beghin on fortepiano, picks up on a suggestion that did not materialize. In October 1775, Leopold Mozart inquired of publisher Breitkopf in Leipzig whether the latter might like to print keyboard sonatas by his son “in the same manner as those of H: Philipp Carl Emanuel Bach mit veränderten Reprisen.” Irving (1998), Levin (2019) and others have proposed a link between Leopold’s offered works and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s recently completed “Munich” Sonatas, K. 279–84 (1774–75). What might Mozart’s Six Sonatas with Varied Reprises have looked like? Reversely, what in Mozart’s score made Leopold think of a possible publication à la Bach?
Using Bach’s Sechs Sonaten mit veränderten Reprisen Wq. 50 (1760) as a guide, Beghin extends a widely documented mid-eighteenth-century practice of embellishing repeats to the actual rewriting of Mozart’s reprises. Reprise here applies to either of the two sections of a sonata-form movement that are to be repeated. The expectation of such a repeat is crucial for our performing and listening to a “varied [repeat of a] reprise” in a rhetorical or pre-organicist paradigm (Broyles 1980; Bonds 1991; Beghin 2015).
That Bach’s printed opus was meant to demonstrate how “one tends to vary the allegros with 2 reprises the second time around” (Bach, 1753) raises the stakes for our engagement with Mozart, who left us with fine examples of embellishing slow movements but whose fast movements in particular leave us guessing as to how he would have handled such an exercise. The idea here is to build on studies of Mozart as improviser (from Levin 1992/2003 to Bandy 2022/2023) but also to commit to a fully written-out, entirely publishable text. While Bach claimed to have invented a new genre “for the use and benefit” of the amateur, our challenge is to apply similar principles to what in Mozart’s household were known as “the difficult sonatas,” removing all repeat signs and replacing these with varied reprises.
This lecture-recital proceeds in three parts. First, it contextualizes the larger issue of “repeat” in the German intellectual-artistic world of 1760–70, asking whether the truism of bis repetita placent (“things that are repeated please”) applied to performing (“one repeats to please more”) or listening (“something being so good that it is worth repeating”). The two, it will be suggested, were interconnected (Junker 1779, Sulzer 1776). Repeats offered musicians the “opportunity” (Quantz 1752) to engage in variation, and constantly applying varietas to one’s style or delivery—retaining the listener’s attention—was the hallmark of a professional, whether orator or musician.
Second, turning to Wq. 50 and its preface, one must acknowledge the paradox in Bach’s gambit, which was to open a professional practice to the amateur. Promising “complete freedom regardless of one’s disposition,” Bach’s experimental format—a continuous script that may be read without having to “ask others to write variations” and “memorizing these with great difficulty”—certainly makes for stylistically inventive playing, where one may apply Bach’s own recently published rules of “good delivery” (Versuch, 1753). “Freedom,” however, does not come to mind when performing off his repeat-sign-less score. The absence of repeat signs—as visual anchoring points—come at a great loss of a player’s voluntas, or the rhetorical intent to either take it “from the top” or re-launch one’s energies toward the next reprise, which normally is accompanied by the not-to-be-missed gesture of turning the page. Yet, even if separated from its usual material-performative environment, “starting over, with variation” remains the musical message in Bach’s opus.
Third, can we apply Bach’s strategies and solutions to Mozart? Here sections will select be selected from K. 279–284, looking for cues in his scores, and the event will end with a performance of a complete sonata, along with the projecting of a newly created score on screen.

In 1775 Leopold Mozart inquired with Breitkopf in Leipzig whether he might like to print an opus of keyboard sonatas by his son, Wolfgang Amadeus, “in the same manner as those of H: Philipp Carl Emanuel Bach mit veränderten Reprisen.” Pitching Wolfgang’s recently completed Sonatas K 279–284 (1774–75), Leopold may also have intended for his nineteen-year-old son to tap into a potentially lucrative amateur market. The publication did not happen, but the question is intriguing: what might such Mozart Sonatas with Varied Reprises have looked like?
            Some larger questions emerge. When performing classical keyboard sonatas, what happens when we submit ourselves to the expectation of continuous variation? How do we navigate the materiality of a printed score? What are the limits to incorporating our variants and at what point do we feel like starting over, and re-composing altogether? How do we tap into the eighteenth-century ideal of a keyboardist as composer-performer, while becoming sensitive to a musical culture that harbored a more fluent use of a musical work, tailored to the needs of a performer?
            These questions will be balanced against an exploration of rhetorical intent behind repetition and variation, Bach’s published thoughts on the matter, and own experiments of teaching and performing Mozart’s sonatas on a Stein fortepiano as the instrument that in 1777 became crucial in the professional life of a maturing improviser and composer.

C. P. E. Bach’s Sonatas with Varied Reprises, published in Berlin, 1760, constituted a bold experiment. Throughout this opus of six Bach spelled out every repeat, integrating into the printed text his own composed variations. This practice of varying repeats normally belonged to the realm of the performer, so Bach was treading on unchartered territory, even inventing (in his own words) “a new genre.” Starting off as a service (“play this and you’ll sound as if you’re improvising”), the opus ends up a masterclass in variation. Tom Beghin, playing his own beloved clavichord (by Joris Potvlieghe, 2003), enacts the role of the keyboardist-composer who repeats himself, while never saying the same thing twice.

This interdisciplinary research project, with sound recording engineers at PXL Music (Hasselt) and video animation researchers at Howest (Kortrijk), has explored the making of digital twins.  Tom Beghin recorded a short piece by W. A. Mozart (the third movement of the Sonata in E-flat Major, K 282), using a replica of a Stein fortepiano (by Chris Maene, 2016, after an original of 1788).  Digital twins were produced both of instrument and performer (using 3D scanning and MetaHuman Creator).  Beghin then played the recorded piece again, using the same instrument and wearing an X Sense Suit, while his movements were mapped using techniques like Mocap and Optitrack (for finger tracking, body movement, and face animations).  Meanwhile, virtual acoustic renderings of two performance venues were combined with animated visual reconstructions of De Kreun (a modern concert hall in Kortrijk) and the ceremonial room of D’Hane-Steenhuyse (an 18th-century palace in Ghent).  The result is an interactive video presentation where all aspects of the animation are combined and synchronized, and where the user, wearing binaural headphones and a VR glasses, can freely walk through a chosen virtual space, randomly switching between D’Hane-Steenhuyse and De Kreun, while fluidly experiencing a “digital twin” performance.
